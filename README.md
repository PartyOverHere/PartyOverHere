## Overview
### Description
Party Over Here is a mobile Android application that allows the user to plan the perfect party, wedding, or social event. The app will take users on a journey from start to finish with planning their events. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category: Lifestyle/Productivity**
- **Mobile:This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would be just as useful on a computer. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.**
- **Story: This app conveniently equips users with access to all of their party planning needs in one place to plan a sure to stand out event.**
- **Market: Anyone who has an event to plan can take advantage of this app. Personalized suggestions are available depending on the needs and interests of the user.**
- **Habit: This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they plan or look for ideas in regards to events.**
- **Scope: First we would start with allowing the user to take our survey to help them plan their parties/events.Then perhaps this could evolve into a larger party planning application as well to broaden its usage to help coordinate larger events. Large potential for use with AirBnb, Zillow, or other location finding applications.**
